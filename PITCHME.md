+++

# What did we learn?

	* Created website from scratch with React 			
+++

# What can we do better?
* Add more customization and features throughout our site
* Implement regular expressions in Search

+++

# Critique of SWEet Travels 

+++

# What did they do well?
* Website is visually pleasing and professional
* All links to and within models function properly
* Site-wide search implementation with OR and regular expressions 

+++ 

# What did we learn from their website?
* Multiple filtering options is useful to narrowing down results
* We need to add a copyright for our great site too

+++

# What can they do better?
* Each state should show the names of the parks located in the state rather than the park code
* Possibly add an indicator to identify that there are no results for a specific filter



+++

# What puzzles us about their website?
* "Menu" button on top left of navigation bar does nothing despite being hoverable and implying clickability 
* At the time of evaluation, the Campgrounds page was labeled "States"
* When there are no filter/search results, the "Prev" and "Next" buttons remain on page

# Thanks for listening!
