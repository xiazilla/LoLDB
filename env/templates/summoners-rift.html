                                <h2>Lore</h2>
                                <p>Summoner's Rift is located in a remote forest between Freljord, and the Ironspike Mountains. The Summoner’s Rift is one of a few locations in Valoran where magical energy is at its greatest concentration, making it a highly sought-after locale to pursue magical endeavors.</p>
                                <p>Historically, the forest where the Rift resides was the site of several battles between two summoner factions symbolized with the Stag and Owl crests, they sought out to use the natural magical energy of the area for their personal use.</p>
                                <p>The large amount of concentrated magic has it mutated the local wildlife. From  giant frogs,  giant birds to  two headed wolves it has also attracted the attention of a powerful  Dragon who currently resides in one of the battle torn ruins.  Sentinels,  Bramblebacks and  Krugs are creatures made from local flora and earth infused to construct a magical being. The Rifts unstable magic has inadvertently cause the reemergence of  Baron Nashor, a large Serpent/Worm largely believed to be dead for centuries. It has his corruption affecting the land around him.</p>
                                <p>Other known creature that live in this area are species of forest chameleons, ducks, Antlermice, Porowls, crows, dragonflies and butterflies.</p>

                                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                                <p>The objective of Summoner's Rift is simple – destroy the enemy nexus. In order to do this, champions must traverse down one of three different paths (or lanes) in order to attack their enemy at their weakest points they can exploit. Both teams have their lanes defended by numerous turrets; each turret grows in strength the closer it gets to its respective nexus and each turret must be eliminated in order to gain access to the next turret in that lane. Cooperating with fellow summoners is an absolute requirement for success, as it is easy for a champion to find themselves ambushed by enemies in the lanes of the Rift.</p>

                                <p>Summoner's Rift during its history had a total of four shopkeepers.</p>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The first one was a Manbacon. This is an infamous race that is living in Runeterra. Manbacionians usually set up shops in a small pack and they also like to smoke. He sold some standard starting items like the <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/1055.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/>  <a href="404.html">Doran's Blade</a>, the <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/1056.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html">Doran's Ring</a>, the <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/1054.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html">Doran's Shield</a>. He was selling his weaponry at both the Blue team and the Purple team bases.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The second shopkeeper was an elderly male Yordle with a cart pulled by an animal resembling a big cat or a rabbit of an unknown species (PBE data mining posted here revealed it to be a \"yonkey\"). He replaced Manbacon and he was also present for both the Blue and the Purple bases.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">A pair of new shopkeepers replacing the previous vendor: in the Blue base there's an elderly female Yordle with a large animal resembling a Bantha from Star Wars and in the Red base there's an elderly male otter merchant attending his shop inside a large hot-air balloon that got punctured.</li>

                                <h2>Summoner's Rift Evolves</h2>
                                <p>On November 12, 2014 a new update to Summoner's Rift went live for use on the Team Builder queue and all bot modes. Then in November 19 the updated Summoner’s Rift was released for all queues, replacing the old one entirely. This time the update has been more heavier than the previous one, and the map was remade from scratch, changing the overall art style. From the minions, to the monsters, the structures, the decorations, the vegetation and even the music it was all completely remade. The new Summoner's Rift is in all respects a new map, made preserving the spirit and gameplay of the older Summoner’s Rift. The new elements are:</p>
                                <h4>General</h4>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">A new handcrafted artistic style to Summoner's Rift.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Gameplay on the map is more readable than in the previous map. Making action the top priority on the screen rather than the environment.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Cleaned up a lot of the terrain (so that the widths of the visuals match the width of the mesh). This is particularly noticeable in Red-side jungle.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Purple Team changed to Red Team.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Red base features an owl and mage motif with curved linear shapes. Blue base is inspired by a stag and paladin theme with blockier shapes. Both of the owl and stag sigils meet in middle lane.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Fog of war upgrade - fog is darker and the fade between fog and non-fog is now more abrupt/crisp (it's not a gradual fade).</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">General bug fixes.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Camera angle adjusted to be more similar to Howling Abyss (higher angled, less perspective). This should make the difference between playing up and down less significant.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Large and Epic Jungle monsters now show their current health value above their health bar.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Bottom and top lane brushes are now centered between their respective towers (previously off-centered by ~450 units).</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Ambient critters have been added in the map.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">New minion and monster icons.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">New Kill indicators on screen (including a hexakill indicator).</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Updated look to minions, cannon minions and super minions. Red minions wield axes while blue minions war hammers.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Two new shopkeepers for both of the Bases.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Each jungle quadrant has a unique theme. Blue buff jungle has a blue hue, while the Red jungle has a red hue. West jungle is more destroyed by the influence of Baron Nashor while the east one retains its more natural look.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">New Summoner's Rift music.</li>
                                <h4>Jungle</h4>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The  Ancient Golem and its  Lizard henchmen were replaced with the  Blue Sentinel golem and two monolithic  Sentries, the Sentries were removed in preseason 7</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The  Golem and  Big Golem have been replaced by the  Krug and  Ancient Krug, respectively.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The  Giant Wolf and the  Lesser Wolves have been respectively replaced with the  Greater Murk Wolf and the  Murk Wolves.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The  Wraiths have been replaced with bird-like  Raptors led by a  Crimson Raptor.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The  Wight has been replaced with the  Gromp, a walrus-frog hybrid.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The  Lizard Elder camp is now inhabited by the  Red Brambleback, a fiery ent-like creature, and two  Cinderlings. The cinderlings were removed in preseason 7</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Dragon and  Baron Nashor have received Visual updates and kit reworks.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">A new passive monster has been added in the north and south parts of the river,  Rift Scuttler.</li>
