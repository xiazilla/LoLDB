                                <p>The Howling Abyss bridge is located in the Freljord and serves as a gateway to the  Frostguard citadel. It replaced the Proving Grounds during the Freljord event and later became the first map for the official ARAM game mode.</p>

                                <p>"This is more than just a bridge, you know. Maybe it was once a simple thing of stone and mortar, but now it bears the weight of the entire Freljord on its back."</p>
                                <p>"The fate of this land was decided here, ages ago, in a long and brutal battle. Just look around and listen, that noise is more than the wind - it is the cry of the vanquished, thrown howling into the abyss!"</p>
                                <p>"Everybody's forgotten  who built this bridge and why. Everybody's forgotten the war that gave this place its scars. Everyone, but me. I was there! I saw the battle! I died here, and I never left this place! I was bound here to stand guard and sound  my war horn if our enemies ever returned."</p>
                                <p>"And now, now the howling grows louder, and I sense something evil stirring in the abyss, my hand reaches for my war horn. This place will soon see a battle again. One that will shape the Freljord for all time. And if the Freljord falls, so too will the rest of the world."</p>
                                <p>"Yes, this is more than just a bridge." -  Gregor    "The Howling Abyss. A bottomless crevasse surrounded by an ancient fortress carved into a glacier. No one remembers  who built this place. No one knows its purpose. No one but me.</p>
                                <p>Long before  Ashe and  Sejuani, before  magic shattered the broken peaks, before  the desert swallowed Shurima, it was the time of The Three Sisters. We were so young back then;  Avarosa,  Serylda, and me, <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/champion/Lissandra.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html"> Lissandra </a>.</p>
                                <p>Back then the Frozen Watchers lived here. I do not know where they came from, but I know they were powerful. They gave us gifts, shared their magic, made us immortal. They named us 'Iceborn'.</p>
                                <p>In return, we gave them whatever they desired. This mighty fortress, a vast empire, our loyalty, these were a small price to pay. Avarosa did not see it that way. Like a spoiled child she cried out for freedom. She demanded choice. She sowed the seeds of rebellion and betrayal.</p>
                                <p>This place is where it happened. On one side, the Frozen Watchers, on the other, Avarosa and her Iceborn horde. Many Iceborn died that day, but in the end, the Watchers fell. Avarosa drove them howling into the abyss.</p>
                                <p>I never forgave her. I had  my revenge... but that is another story."</p>

                                <h4>Howling Abyss now on PBE!</h4>
                                <p>By Richard 'Brackhar' Hough</p>
                                <p>Hey Gang,</p>
                                <p>It's been a while since I first talked to you guys about making ARAM an official gameplay mode, and today I've got something awesome to share with you. For the past few months I've been working with an exceptional team of artists to create a space that's an appropriate setting for both the epic battles that occur in ARAM and within the world of Runeterra at large. As a result, we've completely reworked the Proving Grounds and, in effect, created something entirely new.</p>
                                <p>Now, instead of fighting on a random bridge over a black void, you'll be fighting on the Howling Abyss, an ancient landmark in Freljord where the Iceborn finally overthrew their oppressors and sent them tumbling into the chasm below. As you might have guessed from these mysterious journals, there's more (a lot more!) our story team would love to tell you about Freljord - but for now, you'll have to wait.</p>
                                <p>Anyway, work is still ongoing on the map, and it's yet a few patches away from release but we just wanted to invite you guys in a bit earlier than normal to get your thoughts as we begin to polish it up. The environment team will be actively reading the forum and looking for your feedback, so please let us know what you think!</p>
                                <p>Additionally I wanted to let you guys know that we are actively working on an official matchmaking queue for ARAM and plan to launch it with the map when it's ready. The queue isn't currently enabled on PBE as there's still a good bit of tech work that needs to be resolved to handle the number of players on the environment, but we're fully committed to giving you guys the best experience that we can. So with that, check out the map and explore what we've created; who knows, maybe you'll even find some surprises!</p>
                                </a>

                                <h2>New ARAM Feature: Rerolls</h2>
                                <p>By Richard 'Brackhar' Hough</p>
                                <p>Hey gang,</p>
                                <p>A few weeks ago, I let you know we were working on a matchmaking queue for Howling Abyss, but it wasn't quite ready for testing. Well, with today's PBE patch that's changed! Once PBE comes back up you can try out our new queue and help us test out a new ARAM feature we've added especially for this queue: rerolls.</p>
                                <p>While the random element is a really fun part of Howling Abyss, we also understand there are times you simply don't want to play a particular champion. That's why we created the reroll feature specifically for this queue. When you're really not in the mood to play your particular champion on Murder Bridge, you can reroll and get a different random character instead.</p>
                                <p>Here's how it works. As you play matchmade games on Howling Abyss, win or lose, you'll earn points you can save up to purchase a reroll in champion select. You'll earn a base number of points every match, along with some bonus points based on the number of champions you own. While there is a cap on the number of points you can store up, you'll be able to reroll multiple times in a single champion select if you've got the points.</p>
                                <p>And don't worry about wasting your hard-earned points on queue dodgers. If someone leaves your match at champion select, everyone in the game gets a refund except the player who dodged.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                </a>

                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The Howling Abyss has hosted the Featured Game Modes 'Showdown', 'One for All: Mirror Mode', and 'Legend of the Poro King' (the dedicated summoner spell  Poro Toss /  Poro Dash eventually led to  Mark /  Dash's creation for regular use)</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/2051.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html"> Guardian's Horn</a>, the <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/3184.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html"> Guardian's Hammer</a>, and the <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/3112.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html"> Guardian's Orb </a> all used to belong to  Gregor (a spectral horn can be seen strapped to his back)</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Lyte and his robot Geeves are respectively named after Jeffrey 'Lyte' Lin and Kevin 'Geeves' O'Brien.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Running around the map are little horned furball creatures called  Poros who can be fed a <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/2052.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html"> Poro-Snax </a> (Howling Abyss' 'trinket's) to make them grow in size.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">If all ten players feed the same Poro their <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/item/2052.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html"> Poro-Snaxs </a> it will 'explode' into 10 new Poros who will then proceed to run around the map as well."</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">They used to be killed by the Nexus Obelisk and  Static Field's passive lightning bolts (now they simply run away in fear)</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The turrets for each team might be styled after the Iceborn (blue side) and the Frozen Watchers (purple side) with the game mode itself recreating their battle.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">The gap between the purple nexus and its Obelisk features a silhouette resembling  Lissandra (referencing the purple side being the entrance to the  Frostguard citadel ruled over by the Seeker)</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">The 'Watcher turrets' being purple as well as the Watchers themselves appearing to have a single middle eye might be implying they are related to <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/champion/Velkoz.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html">  Vel'Koz's </a> Voidborn species (he himself is not a Watcher, but a Void rift in the Freljord is likely)</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Standing on the fountain does not grant increased health or mana regen.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">The map features many instances of destructible terrain:</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">If a champion is killed near one of the giant statues skirting each side of the bridge the corresponding one will crumble and break.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">Another bridge in the far background will crumble and fall immediately after any team scoring First Blood.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">Walking past the outermost purple turret will cause a couple of bricks to fall from the crack in the ground nearby.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 80px;">Walking towards the left wall next to the blue inhibitor turret will cause the giant pillar nearby to crash downwards.</li>
                                <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Waiting 30 seconds after winning a match will play a monologue by <img src="https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/7.10.1/img/champion/Lissandra.png" style="width: 2%; height: 2%"/> <a href="404.html">  Lissandra </a> telling the story of the place."</li>
